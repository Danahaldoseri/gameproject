### **_Description_**

#### Hang the man game but without a man.

### The game will be like guessing the letter. I will be giving a hint for example, there will be four letters and the guess is something smells good normally and comes in different colors but is mostly used red, and they should guess the letters or the word if they know already and they pass to next levels, but if the guess a wrong letter they will lose a life, they will have only 3 lives and then game over
